    "The dataset for this assignment is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FV7qofHD_olqygrIjASLQ7k7LTyVSEGG?usp=sharing).  The prediction task is to predict the price of a house (column price) given the other features. Please ignore the columns `id` and `date`, as well as the categorical column `zipcode`. File `kc_house_data.csv` includes all the records in the dataset. The training file `train.csv` and testing file `test.csv` include each 1000 records extracted from the dataset. Please apply the following transformations to the data before using it for this homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scale the data so that each feature has mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n",
    "- Divide the price by 1000 for all rows in the dataset. This will reduce the value of MSE."
